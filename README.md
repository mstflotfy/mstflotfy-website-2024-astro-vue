# Rethinking my webiste: mstflotfy.com, 2024 (Astro, Vue, Radix UI)

This repository is the public source code for the ongoing redesign of my personal website, mstflotfy.com. The goal is to achieve an almost pixel-perfect implementation based on [this design I made in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/MD7o5IooZG46UAGAKV5hbX/Rethink-mstflotfy.com-(ii)?type=design&node-id=54896%3A389&mode=design&t=J6tq53vM6U4YBCDs-1).

## Technologies:

- Astro: Next-gen static site generator for speed and performance.
- Vue.js: Versatile JavaScript framework for dynamic elements and interactivity.
- Radix-vue UI: Comprehensive suite of accessible UI components
